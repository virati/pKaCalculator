# pKaCalculator
pKa calculator for protein structures imported in pdb format

## Introduction

Proteins are composed of various amino acids. These amino acids are critical in determining structural and functional behaviors of the protein and its subunits.

This program was made as a part of a final project for a grad-level X-ray Crystallography course at Texas A&M. The goal is to compute the pKa (a dissociation constant) of a protein structure imported from established filetypes.

Project Timeline: Started circa 2009
